# Cluster markers for Gerry's inventory map

This is the "public" repository to modify cluser markers within Google Maps API.

It goes directly into the javascript code for index.html in https://github.com/Gerry-Care/NIC_map repo.

Must remain public because the image location is truncated and hard-coded into google's library.
